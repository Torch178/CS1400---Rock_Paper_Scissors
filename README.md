# CS1400---Rock_Paper_Scissors

This program simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in which the user selects the number of rounds they would like to play, and goes up against a computer opponent to determine the winner. User will be prompted to enter input and the program then checks that the input is valid (input is either "rock", "paper", or "scissors" ignoring case). The computer then generates it's selection of rock, paper, or scissors using a random number generator with a range from 0 - 2 (0 = rock, 1 = paper, 2 = scissors).

For each round, the user input and computer input are compared, a winner is decided, and a message is output notifying the user of the results and the running score. A counter keeping track of the number of rounds is then updated, and the program moves on to the next round of input. Once all of the rounds ae completed The program outputs the final results of the game and announces a winner.
